### **Project Plan for a Stock Valuation System**

#### **1. Objective**
Develop a static analysis model to rank stocks in the S&P 500 based on their intrinsic value versus current market price. The model should act as a pre-filter for identifying stocks suitable for trading.

#### **2. Data Acquisition**
- **Source**: Use `yfinance` for gathering historical stock prices and other publicly available financial data.
- **Data Points**: Gather daily closing prices, volume, and basic financial metrics. Supplement this with manually collected data (e.g., financial statements for key ratios).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Ensure data consistency and handle missing values.
  - Standardize the `Date` column for time-series alignment.

#### **3. Valuation Metrics**
Implement key valuation metrics that will help identify undervalued or overvalued stocks:
- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Compute P/E using stock price and EPS derived from net income.
- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Calculate using market price and book value per share.
- **Dividend Yield**: For stocks paying dividends, measure attractiveness via current yield.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Use net income and shareholder equity to gauge profitability.
- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**:
  - Estimate future free cash flows using historical data.
  - Apply a suitable discount rate to bring these values to present value.

#### **4. Feature Engineering**
- **Key Features**: Include moving averages (e.g., MA_50, MA_200), volume trends, and technical indicators like RSI, MACD.
- **Standardization**: Normalize numerical data for comparability.
- **Feature Selection**: Choose features directly tied to the stock's valuation and exclude noise.

#### **5. Valuation Model**
- **Static Analysis Method**:
  - Create formulas to calculate intrinsic stock values.
  - Define a scoring system that ranks stocks based on the deviation between intrinsic value and current price:
    ```python
    deviation_score = (calculated_value - current_price) / calculated_value
    ```

#### **6. Ranking Methodology**
- **Scoring Criteria**: Rank stocks from most undervalued to overvalued based on deviation scores.
- **Thresholds**: Set criteria for classifying stocks as ‘Good for Trading’ if they are significantly undervalued (e.g., deviation score > 15%).
- **Output**: Compile a final list of ranked stocks as CSV or DataFrame output.

#### **7. Validation and Backtesting**
- **Run the Model on Historical Data**: Simulate results using past data to ensure the valuation holds up over time.
- **Backtesting System Integration**: Feed the output list into your backtesting framework to check its effectiveness in real-world trading scenarios.

#### **8. Deployment and Maintenance**
- **Code Structure**: Create modular Python scripts for:
  - Data collection (`data_collector.py`)
  - Feature engineering (`feature_processor.py`)
  - Valuation calculation (`valuation_model.py`)
- **Output Management**: Save outputs to CSVs and log results for easy tracking.
- **Maintenance Plan**: Schedule periodic data updates to keep valuations current.

### **Timeline (1-2 Weeks)**
- **Days 1-3**: Set up data collection from `yfinance` and preprocess the data.
- **Days 4-6**: Implement key valuation metrics and feature engineering.
- **Days 7-9**: Develop the scoring and ranking system.
- **Days 10-12**: Validate and backtest the model against historical data.
- **Day 13-14**: Final testing and documentation.
